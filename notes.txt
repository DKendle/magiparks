This will be an application that gives guidance to otherwordly 
places that have been established as National Parks:

Parks:

      "The Lost Woods is a maze-like area of a confusing forest. Its layout is usually designed to make anyone who enters to become irreversibly lost, and the only way to exit the forest is by navigating it in specific directions. Please do not navigate the forrest without the official navigational directions from the The Office of the Other National Parks"},

####Random Trouble Shooting:
npm start
After idling my console for awhile my npm start command stopped working.I would get an error that said "react-script not found".
When I went to my package.json file I saw the following:
`"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }`
 and when I went to the start file in react-scripts nothing was out of the ordinary. I tried turning the computer on/off again, deleting NPM and NODE then reinstalling them, and even went through Homebrew troubleshooting. Out of frustration I forgot to try reinstalling the package itself. So I `npm install react-scripts` again and afterwards the server kicked up like nothing happened.

I had a similar issue with my json-server package and with the uninstall/install dance underway I got that package working again too.


 Somewhere to hold the form state, changing data that we are entering into the form, so that we can manipulate that data later and add the park to the list.
